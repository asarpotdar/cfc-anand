<b>Assistance Network for Agriculture and Natural Disaster (A.N.A.N.D.) - An AI and Blockchain solution for Disaster Preparedness And Recovery</b>

<b>Background & Goal</b><br>

More than 70% of India’s population depends on farming to earn their livelihood and 22% of all damage inflicted by natural disasters such as droughts, floods & storms occur in Agri sector.
Disasters jeopardize agricultural production and development and often have cascading negative effects across national economies
More than 80 percent of the damage and losses caused by drought is to agriculture, especially livestock and crop production
challenges we see at high level: (i) improving information systems at the national and local levels; and (ii) further strengthening resilience in agriculture

<b>Disaster Preparedness & Building Back Better Aftermath</b><br>
As mentioned, better information systems are necessary for better disaster preparedness for Agricultural Sector.
Apart from that a protection scheme that would mitigate the risks to the farmers’ yield(s) is critical to sustaining their livelihood. Crop Insurance is a critical risk mitigation tool for the agricultural economy. However in India the penetration and awareness is not there for govt schemes which is hindering efforts for providing cushion and risk coverage for farmers against the various natural disasters.
The challenge is how to address – <br>
<b>Better Disaster Preparedness for Farmers through Weather/ Disaster Alerts</b><br>
<b>Better Awareness and Outreach for Crop Insurance Schemes</b><br>
<b>Recovery of Farmers after Natural Disasters and getting their life back to normal as early as possible</b><br>

The objective is to develop and establish a network addressing above mentioned challenges for overall better Disaster Preparedness and Recovery

<b>Why we need a better SOLUTION </b><br>
A quick summary of gaps for current Disaster Preparedness and Recovery for Farmers –

Dependency on Govt officials for basic information related to Disaster Preparedness and Recovery measures<br>
Overall lack of awareness about Crop Insurance concept and Adoption of same<br>
Absence of an efficient ecosystem across the entire insurance process<br>
Lack of transparency and speed in claims administration which is hindering efforts of Farmer’s recovery post disaster and in building trust in overall ecosystem <br>
