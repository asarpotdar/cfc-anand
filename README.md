Assistance Network for Agriculture and Natural Disaster (A.N.A.N.D.) - An AI and Blockchain solution for Disaster Preparedness And Recovery

Background & Goal

More than 70% of India’s population depends on farming to earn their livelihood and 22% of all damage inflicted by natural disasters such as droughts, floods & storms occur in Agri sector.
Disasters jeopardize agricultural production and development and often have cascading negative effects across national economies
More than 80 percent of the damage and losses caused by drought is to agriculture, especially livestock and crop production
challenges we see at high level: (i) improving information systems at the national and local levels; and (ii) further strengthening resilience in agriculture

Disaster Preparedness & Building Back Better Aftermath –
As mentioned, better information systems are necessary for better disaster preparedness for Agricultural Sector.
Apart from that a protection scheme that would mitigate the risks to the farmers’ yield(s) is critical to sustaining their livelihood. Crop Insurance is a critical risk mitigation tool for the agricultural economy. However in India the penetration and awareness is not there for govt schemes which is hindering efforts for providing cushion and risk coverage for farmers against the various natural disasters.
The challenge is how to address – 
Better Disaster Preparedness for Farmers through Weather/ Disaster Alerts 
Better Awareness and Outreach for Crop Insurance Schemes
Recovery of Farmers after Natural Disasters and getting their life back to normal as early as possible 

The other challenge we see aligned to this is -  Humanitarian Protection in times of disaster –
The elderly, disabled, and impoverished are statistically more likely to experience the adverse effects of natural disaster, including loss of property and loss of life. Studies show individuals with disabilities or health issues consistently have much higher rates of mortality - up to twice as much as the general population
So another challenge we have is how to address  - 
Better Disaster Preparedness for elderly, disabled, and impoverished people and prepare a contingency plan for them
The objective is to develop and establish a network addressing above mentioned challenges for overall better Disaster Preparedness and Recovery
